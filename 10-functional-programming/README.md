### Announcements
* **QUIZ DUE ???**
* PROJECT WEEK!!!! in a week!
    * We'll assign groups Monday so you can start talking about ideas.
    * ** Your project proposal is due at noon on Wednesday **
    * Basic needs:
        * Each person must make meaningful contributions in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
        * Your web site must have at least 3 interlinked "pages" and clear navigation.
        * Your web site must have at least 2 pages that accept and process user input.
        * Your web site's state must persist (Using a postgres database.)
        * Your web site must be deployed live on the Internet.
        * Your web site must make a call to a third party API.
    * Examples
        * [Yum-Me](http://yum-me.herokuapp.com/)
        * [Garage fellows](garagefellows.herokuapp.com)
        * [Space Tweets](https://tweetsfromspace.herokuapp.com/)
        * [Peer Politics](http://peer-politics.herokuapp.com/)
        * [Handle Me](https://handle-me.herokuapp.com/)
* Questions?

## Misc
* These things help you not to struggle (not advanced, makes it easier):
    * DevTools **always** open in browser
    * Use `psql` or other tool to verify queries
    * Use Postman to verify server behavior

<hr></hr>

## Learning Objectives
* Correctly use **.forEach(), .map(), .filter(), .reduce()** methods to explore and modify a data set
* Construct modularity with IIFE patterns

<hr></hr>

## Notes
* Scope
    * Basics of scope
* Closures
    * IIFE
    * Encapsulation
    * The Javascript Module Pattern
* Functional Programming
    * "Sometimes, the elegant implementation is just a function.  Not a method.  Not a class.  Not a framework.  Just a function."
    * Declarative vs Imperative code
        * Provide examples of imperative coding
        * Provide examples of declarative programming - using JavaScript array methods like** map, filter**, and **reduce**
    * Stateless (Pure) functions
    * Higher order functions
        * **forEach**
        * **map**
        * **reduce**
        * **filter**
* Regex
    * `/\b\w+/g`?
    * regex101.com
* Lab Prep
    * Back to the front end!
    * Modularizing `Article` and `ArticleView` with IIFE's
    * Using higher order array functions to manipulate the data we get from the server

## Readings

* READ: Js&JQ p 528-543 (Essential)
* [Eloquent JavaScript, Ch.5 Higher Order Function*s](http://eloquentjavascript.net/05_higher_order.html) (Essential)
