* API's
    * What is an API?
    * What is a RESTful API?
        * an API that follows the following guidelines:
            * has a base url
            * uses HTTP methods: GET, PUT, POST, DELETE 
            * sends an internet media type (like JSON or XML)

        * [the cat api (note: returns XML!)](http://thecatapi.com/)
        * [marvel api (needs a key)](http://developer.marvel.com/docs)
        * [scratch api](https://wiki.scratch.mit.edu/wiki/Scratch_API_(2.0)#GET_.2Fusers.2F.3Cusername.3E)
