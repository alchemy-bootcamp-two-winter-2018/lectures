Class 6: HTTP, AJAX & JSON
=======
## Overview

Here we go! Onwards, into Week 2 and distributing our application. Which means...

Asynchronous connections... and standardized data formats? This all sounds like a serious upgrade to our application logic! Let's see what you can do with the blog app and your portfolios once we apply these concepts!*

## Asynchronicity

*This week, you will construct a model layer in your application that accesses and transforms persisted data, conforming to common WRRC, FP, and CRUD conventions.*

*Starting with an introduction to the WRRC (web request response cycle), we will learn how HTTP works and how to accomplish simple GET requests through the use of AJAX and jQuery.*

## Readings
* JS & jQ, Ch 8: pp.367-408 (Context: 384-387; Essential: 367-383, 388-399; Reference:400-408)
* [MDN localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Storage_API) (Essential)

## Daily Plan
- Code Review
- New Material
- Code Demos
- Lab Preview

## Learning Objectives

* Identify when apps need persistence, to improve the UX and isolate the model logic in the code base.
* Explain how the browser uses the request-response (WRRC) cycle to render an HTML file or AJAX call.
* Analyze the localStorage object
