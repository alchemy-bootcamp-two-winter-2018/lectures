* Routing and Controllers
    * Controller: what does it do?
        * the chef at our food stand, they take and make orders
        * handles route requests, gets relevant data
    * Single-Page Apps
        * Review: Why single page?
            * Performance trade-offs
            * User experience   
        * jQuery’s role so far
            * Event handling for our tabs
            * Will still be hiding and showing content
        * Benefits of adding a ‘route’ to our page
            * Lets user (and browser) believe they are navigating
            * Updates History API to allow for ‘forward’ and ‘back’ actions 
    * Demo - How
        * Client-side routing
            * Using page.js to handle our routes in our client
            * `app('/<route>', <callback> );` (look familiar?)
            * `app()`'s callback signature: `(ctx,next) => {}` (a little reminiscent of `(req, res)` in our server!)
