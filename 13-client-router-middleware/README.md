## Notes

**Middleware?!?! What's that?**
- You've been using middleware all along: in your Express server
- Middleware functions:
    - receive data (request, response, context)
    - can call the next middleware function
    - analogy: passing the baton in a relay race, especially if they alter the baton in some way; the baton is the data and the runners are the middleware functions
- When do you need middleware?
    - If you want to run the same code regardless of the route being visited
        - For example: using the public directory to serve static files
    - If you want to alter data as it moves through callback functions
        - For example: exposing data on `request.body`
