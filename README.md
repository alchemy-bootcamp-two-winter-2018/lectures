# Bootcamp: Part Two
## Intermediate Software Development

Welcome to Part Two! This class builds on your fundamental knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, git, and general web development, to prepare you for the deep dive of any career track.

# Introduction

We are going to learn about many different topics of web development. The overall structure of the course is based on a common design pattern for web applications: Model-View-Controller (MVC). The course has three modules; in each we'll explore one aspect of this pattern and other related topics.

The general course schedule is:

Full Time  | Topic
-----------|---------------
Module 1     | The View
Module 2     | The Model
Module 3     | The Controller
Module 4     | Project Week

## Class Resources

We will have our own GitHub Organization to manage all of our repositories. All lecture notes and information will be found in this repo, under that day's directory. Your daily labs will have their own repo within this organization.

## Slides, Screencasts, Notes

Any slides used during class will be available from the shared Google Drive linked in the Ryver channel. Lecture outlines and notes will be in each lecture's directory's README. Lectures will also be screencast and uploaded to our class YouTube playlist (linked in the Ryver channel).
